<h2>
Design Decisions
</h2>

<h3>Packages</h3>
<blockquote>
All of the classes that make up the Player and Game applications
are organized into three packages: <code>bingo.player</code>, <code>bingo.game</code>,
and <code>bingo.shared</code>. This organization is straightforward and
is seemingly an obvious choice: The code for the Player application
goes in the <code>bingo.player</code> package, the code for the Game
application goes in the <code>bingo.game</code> package, and all the
classes that are used by both go in <code>bingo.shared</code>. Seems
reasonable enough.
<p>
However, it's worth a few words to explain the benefits of this organization,
why we didn't use <em>more</em> packages, and why certain classes were put
in <code>bingo.shared</code> when they aren't actually shared.
<p>
Organizing the classes into packages provides these main benefits:
<ul>
<li>
The first benefit is simply the benefit of having the classes organized
into groups. The BINGO game is comprised of about 50 classes.
This is a substantial enough number to justify grouping them by
functionality.
If all of the classes were in a single package, then they'd also
be in a single directory. It would be difficult to find classes
and keep them straight.
<li>
By dividing the classes into packages, the classes can use Java's
access levels to restrict or allow access to member variables and
methods based on package membership. If all of the classes were in
the same package, the classes wouldn't have the fine-grain control
over access as they now enjoy. [PENDING: example of this?]
<li>
[PENDING: more?]
</ul>
<p>
The BINGO classes could have been further divided into more packages:
The exceptions and error handling classes could have
all been separated into their own package.
The "listener" classes could have been separated into their own
package, or the UI classes could have been in their own package.
When deciding on the package structure, we decided that three
packages would sufficiently divide the classes into appropriate
functional groups and those packages would also be sufficiently
populated. We decided to use three packages because we felt that
a further divisioin would splinter the classes unnecessarily.
We used class names to help group related classes within the three
packages (for example, all of the exception classes have names
that end in "Exception").
<p>
Like other areas of object-oriented design, many
decisions like this are purely a judgment call. It's more of an art
than a science and reflects personal style. You will find
many programmers making different choices in areas such as this one.
<p>
Some classes and interfaces that are in <code>bingo.shared</code> are
only used by the Game application (such as <code>Constants</code>).
And some classes and interfaces that are in <code>bingo.shared</code>
are only used by the Player application (such as <code>Utilities</code>).
So, why aren't these classes in the application specific packages?
<p>
The packages represent a conceptual organization as well as a 
practical one. A class that is used by only one of the applications
but lives in <code>bingo.shared</code> is one that <em>might</em>
be useful to other applications but is not directly manipulated
by the code in the application in which it's used.
<p>
[PENDING: find out if there are other classes whose package is
a bit unusual or interesting?]
<p>
[PENDING: anything else to say about packages?]
</blockquote>

<h3>Subclasses and Other OO Design Decisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
talk about division of labor and the choice to isolate
certain things from the RingMaster (which could do it all).
<li>
bingo.game.ControlPane subclasses JPanel (why not just use one?)
<li>
discuss parentage of thread subclasses (BallAnnouncer and GamesThread)
<li>
discuss parentage of ListenerThread hierarchy
<li>
discuss parentage of Exception hierarchy
<li>
discuss interesting and exemplary choices of access levels
<li>
discuss the Parameters abstract class  (why we chose to make it
abstract and the access permissions and the overriding done
by its subclasses)
<li>
Make some classes final and discuss them?
</ul>

<h3>Use of Interfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>
BagOfBalls is an interface so that you can swap in your
own class (RandomBag)
<li>
"implements Constants" is interesting because there are no methods
in Constants just constants....class gets direct access to them
(GameParameters.java, RegistrarImpl.java, SocketGate.java)
Applies equally well to States.java implemented by RingMaster
<li>
Some classes implement Serializable...why
<li>
Explain the *Listener interface and the hierarchy

</ul>


<p>
Where does the following belong:

<p>
It's interesting how we designed the UI elements that update themselves
based on broadcast messages from the Game. Where does this go? Is this
an OO thing or a UI thing?

<p>
A thought:
we should highlight somehow the intended function of some classes.
For example in shared there are collection of UI classes and listener
things that are grouped by functionality. Shared also contains miscellaneous
"helper" classes. Perhaps we should further divide things into more packages?
Even if we don't change the package structure, we have to find a way
to make these relationships and functions more obvious...class names?

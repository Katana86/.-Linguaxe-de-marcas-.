<h2>
Avoiding Starvation and Deadlock
</h2>
<blockquote>
The dining philosophers are often used to illustrate various problems
that can occur when many synchronized threads are competing for limited
resources.
<p>
The story goes like this: Five philosophers 
are sitting at a round table. In front of each philosopher is
a bowl of rice. Between each pair of philosophers is one chopstick.
Before an individual philosopher can take a bite of rice he must have
two chopsticks--one taken from the left, and one taken from the right.
The philosophers must find some way to share chopsticks such that they
all get to eat.
<p>
The following applet does a rough animation using an image of Duke for
the dining philosophers. This particular algorithm works as follows:
Duke always reaches for the chopstick on his right first. If the chopstick is
there, Duke takes it and raises his right hand. Next, Duke tries for the
left chopstick. If the chopstick is available, Duke picks it up and raises
his other hand. Now that Duke has both chopsticks, he takes a bite of rice
and says "Mmm!"  He then puts both chopsticks down, allowing
either of his two neighbors
to get the chopsticks. Duke then starts all over again by trying for the
right chopstick. Between each attempt to grab a chopstick, each Duke
pauses for a random period of time.

To run the applet, click the picture.  The applet will appear in a new browser window.</em></center></p>
<p>
The slider controls the amount of time that each philosopher will wait
before attempting to pick up a chopstick. When the slider is set to 0,
the philosophers don't wait--they just grab--and most often, the applet ends up in
deadlock:  all the philosophers are frozen with their right hand in the air.
Why? Because each philosopher immediately has one chopstick and is
waiting on a condition that cannot be satisfied--they
are all waiting for the left chopstick, which is held by the philosopher
to their left.
<p>
When you move the slider so that the waiting period is longer, the applet
may proceed for a while without deadlocking. However, deadlock is always
possible with this particular implementation of the dining philosophers
problem because it is possible for all five philosophers to be holding
their right chopsticks. Rather than rely on luck to prevent deadlock, you
must either prevent it or detect it.
<p>
For most Java programmers, the best choice is to prevent deadlock
rather than to try and detect it.
Deadlock detection is complicated and beyond the scope of this tutorial.
The simplest approach to preventing deadlock is to impose ordering on
the condition variables. In the dining philosopher applet, there is no
ordering imposed on the condition variables because the philosophers and
the chopsticks are arranged in a circle. All chopsticks are equal.
<p>
However, we can change the rules in the applet by numbering
the chopsticks 1 through 5 and insisting that the philosophers
pick up the chopstick with the lower number first. The philosopher
who is sitting between chopsticks 1 and 2 and the philosopher who
is sitting between chopsticks 1 and 5 must now reach for the same
chopstick first (chopstick 1) rather than picking up the one on the
right. Whoever gets chopstick 1 first is now free to take another one.
Whoever doesn't get chopstick 1 must now wait for the first philosopher
to release it. Deadlock is not possible.

<b>Lesson</b>: Using JAR Files: The Basics
</font>

<h2>
Understanding the Manifest
</h2>
<blockquote>
JAR files can support a wide range of functionality, including 
electronic signing, version control, package sealing, extensions, 
and others.  What gives JAR files the ability to be so versatile? 
The answer is embodied in the JAR file's <em>manifest</em>.  
<p>
The manifest is a special file that can contain information about 
the files packaged in a JAR file.  By tailoring this "meta" 
information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file 
to be used for a variety of purposes.
<p>
Before looking at some of the ways manifests can be modified to 
enable special JAR-file functionality, let's take a look at the 
baseline default manifest.
<p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Default Manifest</h3>
<blockquote>
When you create a JAR file, it automatically receives a default 
manifest file. There can be only one manifest file in an 
archive, and it always has the pathname
<blockquote><pre>
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
  When a JAR file 
is created with version 1.2 of the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
Development Kit, the default manifest file is very simple.  Here 
are its full contents:
<blockquote><pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This line shows that a manifest's 
entries take the form of "header: value" pairs. The name of a header 
is separated from its value by a colon. 
The default manifest shows that it conforms to version 1.0 of the 
manifest specification. 
<p>
The manifest can also 
contain information about the other files that are packaged in the archive. 
Exactly what file information is recorded in the manifest will 
depend on what use you intend for the JAR file.  The default 
manifest file makes no assumptions about what information it should 
record about other files, so its single line contains data only about itself.  
<p>
The format of the default manifest file 
changed between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the Java Development Kit. 
If you create a JAR file for the <tt>java.math</tt> package, for example, 
the JDK<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> 1.1 default manifest file would 
look something like this: 
<blockquote><pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0

Name: java/math/BigDecimal.class
SHA1-Digest: TD1GZt8G11dXY2p4olSZPc5Rj64=
MD5-Digest: z6z8xPj2AW/Q9AkRSPF0cg==

Name: java/math/BigInteger.class
SHA1-Digest: oBmrvIkBnSxdNZzPh5iLyF0S+bE=
MD5-Digest: wFymhDKjNreNZ4AzDWWg1Q==
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Like the JDK 1.2 manifest file, the JDK 1.1 manifest has an entry for 
<tt>Manifest-Version</tt>. The version number is the same, indicating 
that the manifest specification didn't change between versions 1.1 and 
1.2 of the JDK software. 
<p>
Unlike the JDK 1.2 manifest file, the JDK 1.1 manifest has entries for each 
file contained in the archive, including the files' pathnames and 
<a href="../sign/intro.html#digest">digest values</a>. The pathnames 
are given as values of the <tt>Name</tt> header. Any headers that 
immediately follow a <tt>Name</tt> header without any intervening 
blank lines, pertain to the file specified by the <tt>Name</tt> header. 
In the manifest above, for example, the first <tt>Name</tt> header is 
followed by these lines:
<blockquote><pre>
SHA1-Digest: TD1GZt8G11dXY2p4olSZPc5Rj64=
MD5-Digest: z6z8xPj2AW/Q9AkRSPF0cg==
</pre></blockquote>
Because these lines follow the <tt>Name</tt> header without any 
intervening blank lines, you know that the digest values they specify 
are the digest values for the file <tt>java/math/BigDecimal.class</tt>.
<p>
Digest values are 
relevant only with respect to signing JAR files. In fact, that's why the 
digest information isn't in the JDK 1.2 default manifest -- it isn't always 
needed.  To learn more about digests and signing, see the 
<a href="../sign/index.html">Signing and Authenticating JAR Files</a> lesson.

<h3>Special-Purpose Manifest Headers</h3>
<blockquote>
Depending on what role you want your JAR file to play, you may need 
to modify the default manifest. If you're interested only in the 
"ZIP-like" features of JAR files such as compression and archiving, 
you don't have to worry about the manifest file. The manifest doesn't 
really play a role in those situations.
<p>
Most uses of JAR files beyond simple archiving and compression 
require special information to be in the manifest file. Summarized 
below are brief descriptions of the headers that are required for 
some special-purpose JAR-file functions:
<ul>
<li><a href="#applications">Applications bundled as JAR files</a>
<li><a href="#download">Download extensions</a>
<!--
<li><a href="#hiding">Hiding implementation classes in JAR files</a>
-->
<li><a href="#sealing">Package sealing</a>
<li><a href="#versioning">Package versioning</a>
</ul>


<p>
<a name="applications"></a>
<h3>Applications Bundled as JAR Files - <em>version 1.2 only</em></h3>
If you have an application bundled in a JAR file, you need some way to 
indicate which class within the JAR file is your application's entry 
point. (Recall that the entry point is the class having a method with 
signature <tt>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;void&nbsp;main(String[]&nbsp;args)</tt>.)
<p>
You provide this information with the <tt>Main-Class</tt> header, which 
has the general form:
<blockquote><pre>
Main-Class: classname
</pre></blockquote>
The value <tt>classname</tt> is the name of the class that is your 
application's entry point.
<p>
<a name="download"></a>
<h3>Download Extensions - <em>version 1.2 only</em></h3>
Download extensions are JAR files that are referenced by the manifest
files of other JAR files. 
See the trail on the 
<a href="../../ext/index.html">extension mechanism</a> for 
information about extensions. 
<p>
In a typical situation, an applet 
will be bundled
in a JAR file whose manifest references a JAR file (or several JAR files)
that will serve as an extension for the purposes of that applet.
Extensions may reference each other in the same way. 
<p>
Download extensions are specified in the <tt>Class-Path</tt> header field in
the manifest file of an applet, application, or another extension. A
<tt>Class-Path</tt> header might look like this, for example: 
<blockquote><pre>
Class-Path: servlet.jar infobus.jar acme/beans.jar
</pre></blockquote>
With this header, the classes in the files <tt>servlet.jar</tt>,
<tt>infobus.jar</tt>, and <tt>acme/beans.jar</tt> will serve as extensions for
purposes of the applet or application. The URLs in the <tt>Class-Path</tt>
header are given relative to the URL of the JAR file of the applet or
application. 

<!--
<p>
<a name="hiding"></a>
<strong>Hiding Implementation Classes in JAR Files - <em>version 1.2 only</em></strong><br>
Your JAR file may contain packages that are part of your software's 
implementation that aren't intended to be publically visible to other 
applications. You can hide such packages by using the 
<tt>Exported-Packages</tt> 
header. When this header is used, only those packages listed as the 
header's value will be visible outside the JAR file.  For example:
<blockquote><pre>
Exported-Packages: com.ourcom.* com.mycom
</pre></blockquote>
specifies that the package <tt>com.mycom</tt> and all packages with 
names beginning with <tt>com.ourcom</tt> will be visible outside the 
JAR file.  All other packages in the JAR file will be hidden.
<p>
If the manifest doesn't have an <tt>Exported-Packages</tt> header, 
<em>all</em> packages are visible.
-->
<p>
<a name="sealing"></a>
<h3>Package Sealing - <em>version 1.2 only</em></h3>
A package within a JAR file can be optionally sealed, which means 
that all classes defined in that package must be archived in the same JAR 
file.  
You might want to seal a package, for example, to ensure 
version consistency among the classes in your software or as a 
security measure. 
<p>
To seal a package, you need to add a <tt>Name</tt> header for the 
package, followed by a <tt>Sealed</tt> header, similar to this:
<blockquote><pre>
Name: myCompany/myPackage/
Sealed: true
</pre></blockquote>
The <tt>Name</tt> header's value is the package's relative pathname. 
Note that it ends with a '<tt>/</tt>' to distinguish it from a filename. 
Any headers following a <tt>Name</tt> header, without any intervening 
blank lines, apply to the 
file or package specified in the <tt>Name</tt> header. In the above example, 
because the <tt>Sealed</tt> header occurs after the 
<tt>Name:&nbsp;myCompany/myPackage</tt> header, with no blank lines 
between, the <tt>Sealed</tt> header will be interpreted as applying 
(only) to the package <tt>myCompany/myPackage</tt>.

<a name="versioning"></a>
<h3>Package Versioning - <em>version 1.2 only</em></h3>
The 
<a target="other" href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/versioning/spec/VersioningSpecification.html#PackageVersioning"><font color="#009bbb">Package Versioning specification</font></a><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/versioning/spec/VersioningSpecification.html#PackageVersioning"><img src="../../images/otherIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt="(outside of the tutorial)"></a>  defines several manifest headers to hold versioning information. One set of such headers can be assigned to 
each package. The versioning headers should appear directly beneath 
the <tt>Name</tt> header for the package. This example shows all 
the versioning headers:
<blockquote><pre>
Name: java/util/
Specification-Title: "Java Utility Classes" 
Specification-Version: "1.2"
Specification-Vendor: "Sun Microsystems, Inc.".
Implementation-Title: "java.util" 
Implementation-Version: "build57"
Implementation-Vendor: "Sun Microsystems, Inc."
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>

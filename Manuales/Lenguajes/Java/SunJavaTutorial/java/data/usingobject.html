<h2>
Using Objects
</h2>
<blockquote>
Once you've created an object,
you probably want to use it for something.
You may need information from it,
want to change its state,
or have it perform some action.
<p>
Objects give you two ways to do these things:
<ol>
<li> Manipulate or inspect its variables.
<li> Call its methods.
</ol>

<a name=variables>
</blockquote>
<h3>Referencing an Object's Variables</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
The <code>CreateObjectDemo</code> program creates
a rectangle named <code>rect_two</code>.
The constructor used to create that rectangle initializes the
rectangle's origin to 0, 0.
Later the program changes the rectangle's origin
with this statement:
<blockquote><pre>
rect_two.origin = origin_one;
</pre></blockquote>
This statement moves the rectangle
by setting its point of origin to a new position.
<code>rect_two.origin</code> is the name of <code>rect_two</code>'s
<code>origin</code> variable.
You can use these kinds of object variable names
in the same manner as you use other variables names.
Thus, as in the previous example code,
you can use the <code>=</code> operator
to assign a value to <code>rect_two.origin</code>.
<p>
The <code>Rectangle</code> class has two other variables--
<code>width</code> and <code>height</code>--
that are accessible to objects outside of the class.
The program displays them with this code:
<blockquote><pre>
System.out.println("Width of rect_one: " + <strong>rect_one.width</strong>);
System.out.println("Height of rect_one: " + <strong>rect_one.height</strong>);
</pre></blockquote>
In general, to refer to an object's variables,
append the name of the variable
to an object reference with an intervening period (.):
<blockquote><pre>
<em>objectReference</em>.<em>variable</em>
</pre></blockquote>
The first part of the variable's name,
<code><em>objectReference</em></code>,
must be a reference to an object.
You can use an object name here
just as was done in the previous examples with <code>rect</code>.
You also can use any expression
that returns an object reference.
Recall that the <code>new</code> operator
returns a reference to an object.
So you could use the value returned from
<code>new</code> to access a new object's variables: 
<blockquote><pre>
height = new Rectangle().height;
</pre></blockquote>
This statement creates a new <code>Rectangle</code> object
and immediately gets its height.
Effectively, the statement calculates
the default height of a <code>Rectangle</code>.
Note that after this statement has been executed,
the program no longer has a reference
to the <code>Rectangle</code> that was created
because the program never stored the reference in a variable.
Thus the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
<P>
Here's a final word about accessing an object's variables
to clear up a point of some confusion
that beginning Java programmers often have.
All objects of the same type have the same variables.
All <code>Rectangle</code> objects have <code>origin</code>,
<code>width</code>, and <code>height</code> variables
that they got from the <code>Rectangle</code> class.
When you access a variable through an object reference,
you reference that particular object's variables.
Suppose that <code>bob</code> is also a rectangle
in your drawing program
and it has a different height and width than <code>rect</code>.
The following instruction calculates the area
of the rectangle named <code>bob</code>,
which differs from the previous instruction
that calculated the area of <code>rect</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
area = bob.height * bob.width;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name=methods>
<h3>Calling an Object's Methods</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
To move <code>rect</code> to a new location
using its <code>move</code> method, you write this:
<blockquote><pre>
rect.move(15, 37);
</pre></blockquote>
This Java statement calls <code>rect</code>'s <code>move</code> method
with two integer parameters, 15 and 37.
It moves the <code>rect</code> object
because the <code>rect</code> method
assigns new values to <code>origin.x</code> and <code>origin.y</code>
and is equivalent to the assignment statement used previously: 
<blockquote><pre>
rect.origin = new Point(15, 37);
</pre></blockquote>
The notation used to call an object's method
is similar to that used when referring to its variables:
You append the method name to an object reference
with an intervening period (.).
Also, you provide any arguments
to the method within enclosing parentheses.
If the method does not require any arguments,
use empty parentheses. 
<blockquote><pre>
<em>objectReference</em>.<em>methodName</em>(<em>argumentList</em>);
   or
<em>objectReference</em>.<em>methodName</em>();
</pre></blockquote>
As stated previously in this lesson,
<code><em>objectReference</em></code>
must be a reference to an object.
You can use a variable name here,
but you also can use any expression
that returns an object reference.
The <code>new</code> operator returns an object reference,
so you can use the value returned from <code>new</code>
to call a new object's methods: 
<blockquote><pre>
new Rectangle(100, 50).area()
</pre></blockquote>
The expression <code>new Rectangle(100, 50)</code>
returns an object reference
that refers to a <code>Rectangle</code> object.
As shown, you can use the dot notation
to call the new <code>Rectangle</code>'s <code>area</code> method
to compute the area of the new rectangle. 
<p>
Some methods, like <code>area</code>, return a value.
For methods that return a value,
you can use the method call in expressions.
You can assign the return value to a variable,
use it to make decisions, or control a loop.
This code assigns the value returned by area to a variable: 
<blockquote><pre>
int areaOfRectangle = new Rectangle(100, 50).area();
</pre></blockquote>
Remember, invoking a method on a particular object
is the same as sending a message to that object.
In this case, the object is the rectangle returned by the constructor.
</blockquote>

<h3>A Word About Variable Access</h3>
<blockquote>
Ideal object-oriented programming discourages
the direct manipulation of an object's variables
because it would be possible to set the variables
to values that don't make sense.
For example, consider the <code>Rectangle</code>
class from the previous section.
Using that class,
you can create a rectangle whose width and height
are negative, which, for some applications, doesn't make sense.
<p>
Instead of allowing direct manipulation of an its variables,
an ideal class provides methods through
which you can inspect or change its variables.
These methods ensure that the values of the variables
make sense for objects of that type.
So, the <code>Rectangle</code> class would provide
methods for setting and getting the <code>width</code>
and the <code>height</code>.
The methods for setting the variables would report an error,
if the caller tried to set the width or height to a negative number.
<p>
However, in practical situations,
it sometimes makes sense to allow direct access to
an object's variables.
For example,
both the <code>Point</code> class
and the <code>Rectangle</code> class
allow free access to their member variables.
This keeps these classes small and simple.
Also, it keeps them generally useful.
Some applications might allow rectangles
with negative widths and heights.
<p>
Java provides an access control mechanism
whereby classes can determine which other
classes can have direct access
to its variables and methods.
A class should protect variables
against direct manipulation by other objects
if those manipulations could result in values
that don't make sense objects of that type.
State changes should then be affected
and therefore controlled by method calls.
If an object grants access to its variables,
you can assume that you can inspect
and change them without adverse effects.

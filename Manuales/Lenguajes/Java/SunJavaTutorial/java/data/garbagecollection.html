<h2>
Cleaning Up Unused Objects
</h2>
<blockquote>
Many other object-oriented languages require
that you keep track of all of the objects
you create and that you explicitly destroy
them when they are no longer needed.
This technique of managing memory
is tedious and often error-prone.
Java allows you to create as many objects as you want
(limited, of course, by what your system can handle),
and you never have to worry about destroying them.
The Java runtime environment deletes objects
when it determines that they are no longer being used.
This process is called <em>garbage collection</em>.
<p>
An object is eligible for garbage collection
when there are no more references to that object.
References that are held in a variable
are naturally dropped when the variable goes out of scope.
Or you can explicitly drop an object reference
by setting the variable to null. 

</blockquote>
<h3>The Garbage Collector</h3>
<blockquote>
The Java platform has a garbage collector
that periodically frees the memory used
by objects that are no longer needed.
The Java garbage collector
is a mark-sweep garbage collector.
A mark-sweep garbage collector
scans dynamic memory areas
for objects and marks those that are referenced.
After all possible paths to objects are investigated,
unmarked objects (unreferenced objects)
are known to be garbage and are collected.
(A more complete description
of Java's garbage collection algorithm
might be "a compacting, mark-sweep collector
with some conservative scanning.") 
<p>
The garbage collector runs in a low-priority thread
and runs either <em>synchronously</em> or <em>asynchronously</em>
depending on the situation and the system on which Java is running.
It runs synchronously when the system runs out of memory
or in response to a request from a Java program. 
<p>
The Java garbage collector runs <em>asynchronously</em>
when the system is idle,
but it does so only on systems,
such as Windows 95/NT,
that allow the Java runtime environment
to note when a thread has begun and to interrupt another thread.
As soon as another thread becomes active,
the garbage collector is asked to get to a consistent state and terminate.
</blockquote>

<h3>Finalization</h3>
<blockquote>
Before an object gets garbage-collected,
the garbage collector gives the object
an opportunity to clean up after itself
through a call to the object's <code>finalize</code> method.
This process is known as <em>finalization</em>. 
<p>
Most programmers don't have to worry about
implementing <code>finalize</code>.
In rare cases, however,
a programmer might have to implement a <code>finalize</code>
method to release resources, such as native peers,
that aren't under the control of the garbage collector. 

<p>
The <code>finalize</code> method is a member
of the <code>Object</code> class,
which is the top
of Java's class hierarchy and the parent of everything.
A class can override the <code>finalize</code> method
to perform any finalization necessary for objects of that type.
If you override <code>finalize</code>,
then your implementation of the method
should call <code>super.finalize</code> as the last thing it does.

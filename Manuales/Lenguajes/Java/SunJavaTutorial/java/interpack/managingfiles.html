<h2>
Managing Source and Class Files
</h2>
<blockquote>
The JDK relies on hierarchical file systems to manage source and class
files for Java programs, although <em>The Java Language Specification</em> does
not require this. The strategy is as follows.
<p>
You put the source code for a class or interface in a text file whose
name is the short name of the class or interface and whose extension is
<code>.java</code>
(the JDK requires this extension for public classes and it's a
good idea for other classes). Then, you put the source file in a
directory whose name reflects the name of the package to which the
class or interface belongs. For example, the source code for the
<code>Rectangle</code> class would be in a file named
<code>Rectangle.java</code> and the file would be in a directory named
<code>graphics</code>.
The <code>graphics</code> directory may be
anywhere on the file system. The following diagram shows how this works.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/25rectan.gif" WIDTH="349" HEIGHT="77" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
The long name of the package member and the pathname to the file are
parallel (assuming the UNIX filename separator slash / ):
<blockquote><pre>
graphics.Rectangle           <em>class name</em>
graphics/Rectangle.java	     <em>pathname to file</em>
</pre></blockquote>
Furthermore, by convention, each company uses its reversed Internet
domain name in its package names. (However, some companies now choose
to drop "com" from their package names.) The fictional company called
Taranis Interactive whose Internet domain name is <code>taranis.com</code> would
precede all of its package names with <code>com.taranis</code>.
Each component of
the package name corresponds to a subdirectory.
So, if Taranis had a
<code>graphics</code> package that contained a <code>Rectangle.java</code>
source file, it would
be contained in a series of subdirectories, as shown here:

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/26packag.gif" WIDTH="406 " HEIGHT="127" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
When you compile a source file, the compiler creates a different output
file for each class and interface defined in it. The basename of the
output file is the name of the class or interface, and its extension is
<code>.class</code>:

<p><center><a href="../../figures/java/27helper.gif" target="_top"><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/27helper.gif" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="128" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></a><br><em>This figure has been reduced to fit on the page. <br> Click the image to view it at its natural size.</em></center></p>
Like a <code>.java</code> file, a <code>.class</code> file should also
be in a series of directories that reflect the package name. However,
it does not have to be in the same directory as its source. You could
arrange your source and class directories separately, like this:

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/28classes.gif" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="159" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
By doing this, you can give the classes directory to other programmers
without revealing your sources.
<p>
Why all the bother about directories and filenames? You need to manage
your source and class files in this manner so that the compiler and the
interpreter can find all of the classes and interfaces used by your
program. When the compiler encounters a new class as it's compiling
your program, it must be able to find the class so as to resolve names,
do type checking, and so on. Similarly, when the interpreter encounters
a new class as it's running your program, it must be able to find the
class to invoke its methods, and so on. Both the compiler and the
interpreter search for classes in each directory or zip file listed in
your class path.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Definition:</strong>&nbsp;
A class path is a list of directories or zip files to search for class files.
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
Each directory listed in the class path is a top-level directory in
which package directories appear. From the top-level directory, the
compiler and the interpreter can construct the rest of the path based
on the package and class name for the class. For example, the class
path entry for the directory structure shown in the previous diagram
page would include <code>classes</code>, but not <code>com</code> or any of the
directories below <code>com</code>.
Both the compiler and the interpreter construct
the path name to a <code>.class</code> file with its full package name.
<p>
By default, the compiler and the interpreter search the current
directory and the zip file containing the JDK class files. In other
words, the current directory and the JDK class files are automatically
in your class path. Most, if not all, classes can be found in these two
locations. So it's likely that you don't have to worry about your class
path. In some cases, however, you may have to set your class path.

</blockquote>
<h3>Setting the Class Path</h3>
<blockquote>
If you must, you can change your class path.
This can be done in either of two ways:
<ol>
<li>
Set the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable (not recommended).
<li>
Use the <code>-classpath</code> runtime option when you invoke the
compiler or the interpreter.
</ol>
We don't recommend setting the <code>CLASSPATH</code>
environment variable because
it can be long-lived (particularly if you set it in a login or startup
script). It's also easy to forget about, and then one day, your
programs won't work because the compiler or interpreter loads a crusty
old class file instead of the one you want. An old, out-of-date
<code>CLASSPATH</code> variable is a fruitful source of confusing problems.
<p>
The second option, setting the class path with the runtime option, is
preferable because it sets the class path only for the current
invocation of the compiler or the interpreter. Here's how to use the
runtime option <code>-classpath</code> to set your class path.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Platform-specific Details: Using the -classpath Runtime Option:</strong>&nbsp;
<p>

UNIX:
<blockquote><pre>
javac -classpath .:~/classes:/JDK/lib/classes.zip
</pre></blockquote>
DOS shell (Windows 95/NT): 
<blockquote><pre>
javac -classpath .;C:\classes;C:\JDK\lib\classes.zip
</pre></blockquote>
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
When you specify a class path in this manner, you completely override
the current class path. Thus you must include the <code>classes.zip</code>
file from the JDK in the class path. It's a good idea to include the current
directory as well.
<p>
The order of the entries in the class path is important. When the Java
interpreter is looking for a class, it searches the entries in your
class path, in order, until it finds a class with the correct name. The
Java interpreter runs the first class with the correct name that it
encounters and does not search the remaining entries.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;
If you load an applet into a Java application such as HotJava or the
Applet Viewer and the loaded class is in the class path, the applet
doesn't have the restrictions that applets loaded over the network do,
so it can never be reloaded. We recommend never starting an application
such as HotJava in the same directory as an Applet class because the
current directory "." is usually part of the class path.
<hr></blockquote>

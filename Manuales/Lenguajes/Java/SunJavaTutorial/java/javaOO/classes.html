<h2>
Creating Classes
</h2>
<blockquote>
Now that we've covered how
to create and use objects, and how objects are cleaned up,
it's time to show you how
to write the classes
from which objects are created.
This section shows you the main components
of a class through a small example
that implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack.
The following diagram lists the class
and identifies the structure of the code.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/13parts.gif" WIDTH="466" HEIGHT="440" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
This implementation of a stack uses another object, a
<code>Vector</code>,
to store its elements.
<code>Vector</code> is a growable array of objects
and does a nice job of allocating space
for new objects as space is required.
The <code>Stack</code> class makes use of this code
by using a <code>Vector</code> to store its elements.
However, it imposes LIFO restrictions
on the <code>Vector</code>--
that is, you can only add elements to
and remove elements from the top of the stack.

</blockquote>
<h3><a href="classdecl.html">The Class Declaration</a></h3>
<blockquote>
The previous diagram
shows that two primary components
make up the implementation of a class:
the class declaration and the class body.
The class declaration declares the name of the class
along with other attributes.
The class declaration for the <code>Stack</code>
class is fairly simple and indicates
that the class is public and that its name is <code>Stack</code>.
Often, a minimal class declaration such as this one is all you'll need. 
<p>
However, the class declaration can say more about the class,
such as the name of the superclass and if it can be subclassed.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="classbody.html">The Class Body</a></h3>
<blockquote>
The class body follows the class declaration and is embedded
within curly braces { and }. The class body contains
declarations for all instance variables and class variables (known
collectively as member variables) for the class. In addition, the
class body contains declarations and implementations for all instance
methods and class methods (known collectively as methods) for the
class.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="constructors.html">Providing Constructors for Your Classes</a></h3>
<blockquote>
A class may contain one or more constructors that provide
for the initialization of an object created from the class.
This section shows you how to write a constructor.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="variables.html">Declaring Member Variables</a></h3>
<blockquote>
A class's state is represented by its member variables.
You declare a class's member variables in the body of the class.
Typically, you declare a class's variables before
you declare its methods, although this is not required.
<blockquote><pre>
<em>classDeclaration</em> {
    <em>member variable declarations</em>
    <em>method declarations</em>
}
</pre></blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> To declare variables that are members of a
class, the declarations must be within the class body, but <strong>not</strong>
within the body of a method. Variables declared within the body of a method
are local to that method.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="methods.html">Implementing Methods</a></h3>
<blockquote>
As you know, objects have behavior that is implemented
by its methods. Other objects can ask an object to do something by
invoking its methods. This section tells you everything you need to know
about writing methods for your Java classes. For more information about
how to call methods see
<a target="_top" href="../data/usingobject.html">Using Objects</a><a target="_top" href="../data/usingobject.html"><img src="../../images/tutorialIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a>.
<p>
In Java, you define a class's methods in the body of the class for
which the method implements some behavior. Typically,
you declare a class's methods after its variables in the class body
although this is not required.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="accesscontrol.html">Controlling Access to Members of a Class</a></h3>
<blockquote>
Member variables and methods are known collectively as <em>members</em>.
When you declare a member of a Java class, you can
allow or disallow other objects of other types access to that member
through the use of <em>access specifiers</em>.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="classvars.html">Understanding Instance and Class Members</a></h3>
<blockquote>
A Java class can contain two different types of members: instance members
and class members. This page shows you how to declare both types of 
members and how to use them.

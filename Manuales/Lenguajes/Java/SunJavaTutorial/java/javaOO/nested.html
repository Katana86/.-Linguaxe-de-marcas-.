<h2>
Implementing Nested Classes
</h2>
<blockquote>
Java lets you define a class as a member of another class.
Such a class is called a <em>nested class</em>
and is illustrated here:
<blockquote><pre>
class EnclosingClass{
    . . .
    class ANestedClass {
        . . .
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Definition:</strong>&nbsp;
A nested class is a class that is a member of another class.
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
You use nested classes to reflect and enforce the relationship between
two classes. You should define a class within another class when the
nested class makes sense only in the context of its enclosing class or
when it relies on the enclosing class for its function. For example, a
text cursor makes sense only in the context of a particular text
component.
<p>
As a member of its enclosing class, a nested class has a special
privilege: It has unlimited access to its enclosing class's members,
even if they are declared private. However, this special privilege
isn't really special at all. It is fully consistent with the meaning of
private and the other access specifiers. The access specifiers restrict
access to members for classes <em>outside</em> of the enclosing class. The
nested class is <em>inside</em> of its enclosing class so that it has access to
its enclosing class's members.
<p>
Like other members, a nested class can be declared static (or not). A
static nested class is called just that: a <em>static nested class</em>. A
nonstatic nested class is called an <em>inner class</em>. These are illustrated
in the following code:
<blockquote><pre>
class EnclosingClass{
    . . .
    static class AStaticNestedClass {
        . . .
    }
    class InnerClass {
        . . .
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
As with static methods and variables (normally called class methods and
variables), a static nested class is associated with its enclosing
class. And like class methods, a static nested class cannot refer
directly to instance variables or methods defined in its enclosing
class-it can use them only through an object reference.
<p>
As with instance methods and variables, an inner class is associated
with an instance of its enclosing class and has direct access to that
object's instance variables and methods. Also, because an inner class
is associated with an instance, it cannot define any static members
itself.
<p>
To help differentiate the terms nested class and inner class further,
we suggest you think about them in the following way. The term "nested
class" reflects the <em>syntactic relationship between two classes</em>;
that is, syntactically, the code for one class appears within the code of
another. In contrast, the term "inner class" reflects the <em>relationship
between instances of the two classes</em>. Consider the following classes:
<blockquote><pre>
class EnclosingClass {
    . . .
    class InnerClass {
        . . .
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
The interesting feature about the relationship between these two
classes is not that <code>InnerClass</code> is syntactically defined within
<code>EnclosingClass</code>.
Rather, it's that an instance of <code>InnerClass</code> can exist
only within an instance of <code>EnclosingClass</code>
and that it has direct access
to instance variables and methods of its enclosing instance.
The following diagram illustrates this idea.


<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/24inner.gif" WIDTH="347" HEIGHT="72" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
You may encounter nested classes of both kinds in the Java API and be
required to use them. However, most nested classes that you write will
be inner classes.
<p>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Definition:</strong>&nbsp;
An <em>inner class</em> is a nested class whose instance exists within an
instance of its enclosing class and has direct access to the instance
members of its enclosing instance.
<hr></blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3>Other Facts about Nested Classes</h3>
<blockquote>
Like other classes, nested classes can be declared <code>abstract</code>
or <code>final</code>.
The meaning of these two modifiers for nested classes is the same as
for other classes. Also, the access specifiers--<code>private</code>,
<code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and package---
may be used to restrict access to nested classes
just as they do to other class members.
<p>
Any nested class, not just anonymous ones, can be declared in any block
of code. A nested class declared within a method or other smaller block
of code has access to any final, local variables in scope.

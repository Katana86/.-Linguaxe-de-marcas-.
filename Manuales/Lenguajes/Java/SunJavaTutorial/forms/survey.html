The response to our survey was amazing:
We received almost 700 responses.
<br>
<strong>Thank you!</strong>
<p>
Your comments have been very helpful to the tutorial team:
you told us what you like and what you don't,
you provided us with a lot of good ideas,
and you told us what you'd like our priorities to be.
We'll do our best to implement many of your suggestions.
